# HotelBookingSystem

# Installs

1. Go to this website to download Eclipse:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
   - **Using Eclipse will be much easier to perfome testing compare to other compiler.**
   - The link below contains the guideline to complete the downloading process : https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer

2. Go to  this website to download VMware:
https://www.vmware.com/info/workstation-player/evaluation
   - **VMware is a vitual machine is a virtualization and cloud computing software provider.** 
User can us VMware to gain asses to Windows10 to Windows 11.

# Prerequisite
**Junit4 and Jar files must be installed and set up properly**
For the following process, please refer to **Set Up The Enviroment**.

# Set Up
1. Download all the files provided onto your desktop.
2. Open your Eclipse.
3. On the top left-hand corner, you can see **File**; click on it.
4. Next, click on **import**.
5. Click **Next** and choose **Browse**. (This will lead you into your directory and select the folder you had downloaded just now.)
6. Click **Finish**.
7. Now you can see the project file on the right-hand side in Eclipse.

**Reminder**
1. If your libary dependency is below JAVA-SE18, you have to change to Java System Libary (JAVA SE-20).




# Test Description

Junit is a widely used testing framework for Java programming. It helps developers swrite and run tests for their code, ensuring that individual units of functionality work as intended.

## Installed jar files
1.	Provide the jar file
2.	Install the jar file on your own laptop or PC it will be use after this.

## Set Up The Environment
1.	Eclipse contains the JUnit package to create a JUnit test.

2.	The library can be added during the creation of class using the wizard. If we want to add it later, **right-click** on project name in the packges explorer and select **Build Path -> Add Libraries**.

3.	Select the JUnit from the list. Then, click **[Next]**

4. Select JUnit 4 and then **[Finish]**, You should see the JUnit library has been added into the project in the package explorer.

5. The **jar file** can be added during the creation of class using the wizard. If we want to add it later, right-click on project name in the package explorer and select confugure build path.

6.	Select Add External JARs at **right hand side.**

7.	Select **All** the jar file on your desktop file, then click **open**.

8.	After that, we can see the jar that we selected was shown in the library. Then click **Apply and Close** at the right bottom.

9.	You also may check the library and jar file that are added on the left-hand side.

10.	Once we set up the testing environment , we are able to conduct unit testing, integration testing and test suite

## Unit Test
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual components or functions of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they work as expected. These tests are typically automated and focus on verifying the correctness of specific parts of the code, often called "units."

1.	The @RunWith(JUnitParamsRunner.class) annotation is used in JUnit testing to specify a custom runner class that will execute the test class. In this case, the JUnitParamsRunner is a runner provided by the JUnitParams library, which is used to support parameterized tests in JUnit.

2.	To make the method will run in test, there must be an @Test before the method.

3.	Example code:
```java
//test the setRoomsWishToBook
    @Test
    @Parameters({"guest, 1, 1", "normal, 2, 2", "VIP, 3, 3"})
    public void setRoomWishToBookWithValid(String member_type, int count, int expectedResult) {
        User u = new User("TestUser", member_type); // Create a User object with a name and member type
        u.setRoomsWishToBook(count); 
        assertEquals(expectedResult, u.getRoomsWishToBook()); 
    }

 //test set name
    @Test
    @Parameters({"Jason,Jason","Emily,Emily"})
    public void setNameWithValid(String name,String expectedResult)
    {
    	//User u = new User("TestUser", "member");
    	u.setName(name);
    	String actualResult = u.getName();
    	assertEquals(expectedResult,actualResult);
    }
```
4.	To view if the testing method is valid or invalid, we can click the green icon for run. Then it will show the result green color means valid or successful, red color means invalid or unsuccessful.

## Integration Test
1.	The @RunWith(JUnitParamsRunner.class) annotation is used in JUnit testing to specify a custom runner class that will execute the test class. In this case, the JUnitParamsRunner is a runner provided by the JUnitParams library, which is used to support parameterized tests in JUnit.

2.	For run the integration test , we will use the @Before and @After annotations in the test method.


3.	The @Before annotation in JUnit is used to specify a method that should be executed before each test method in the test class. This method is often used to set up the test environment, initialize data, or configure necessary resources to ensure that each test starts from a known and consistent state.

```java
@Before
	public void setUpTests() {
		//this is to set up the availablerooms.txt file to 5,5,5 Before each test
		try {
	    	PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("availablerooms.txt");
	    	pw.println("5,5,5");
	    	pw.close();
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

	}

4.	The @After annotation in JUnit is used to specify a method that should be executed after each test method in the test class. This method is often used for cleanup activities or to reset the test environment to a consistent state, ensuring that tests do not interfere with each other.


@After
	public void afterTests() {
		try {
			//this is to reset the availablerooms.txt file to 5,5,5 after each test
	    	PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("availablerooms.txt");
	    	pw.println("5,5,5");
	    	pw.close();
		} catch (IOException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	User vip1 = new User("xy","VIP");
	User vip2 = new User("as","VIP");
	User vip3 = new User("ch","VIP");
	User vip4 = new User("ws","VIP");
	User vip5 = new User("jason","VIP");
	User vip6 = new User("jasmine","VIP");
	User normal1 = new User("nor1", "normal");
	User normal2 = new User("nor2", "normal");
	User normal3 = new User("nor3", "normal");

	User guest4 = new User("guest4", "guest");
	User guest5 = new User("guest5", "guest");
	User guest6 = new User("guest6", "guest");
